VMC        # Type of calculation: VMC or PDMC
1.2        # Value of the amplitude of the wave function ->  a
10000      # Number of steps for the MC calculation -> N_MC
1.0        # Value of dt, recommended: 1.0 (VMC) or 0.05 (PDMC)
100.0      # Value of tau for PDMC
-0.5       # Value of reference energy, eref, for PDMC
